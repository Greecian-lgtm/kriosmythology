  "Who Are the 12 Olympian Gods?" \
  "The 12 Olympian gods are Zeus, Hera, Poseidon, Demeter, Athena, Apollo, Artemis, Ares, Hephaestus, Aphrodite, Hermes, and Dionysus. Here is what the primary sources actually say about each one." \
  "Who Are the 12 Olympian Gods?" \
  "Hesiod Theogony, Homeric Hymns, Pindar" \
  "The 12 Olympian gods are <strong>Zeus, Hera, Poseidon, Demeter, Athena, Apollo, Artemis, Ares, Hephaestus, Aphrodite, Hermes, and Dionysus</strong>. They are called Olympians because they were believed to dwell on Mount Olympus in northern Greece. The list of twelve was not fixed in Homer — it solidified gradually in Greek religious tradition, and Hestia is sometimes listed in place of Dionysus." \
  "The concept of twelve Olympian gods — the Dodekatheon — became central to Greek religious life, but the ancient sources do not all agree on exactly who belongs in the twelve. Hesiod's Theogony describes the genealogy of the gods without fixing a number. The canonical list of twelve emerged through artistic tradition, particularly the twelve gods depicted on the east frieze of the Parthenon." \

  "Odysseus is the hero of Homer's Odyssey, a 24-book epic describing his 10-year journey home from Troy. Here is what Homer actually says — not the popular retelling." \
  "What Is the Real Story of Odysseus?" \
  "Homer Odyssey, Homer Iliad, Sophocles" \
  "Odysseus is the king of Ithaca and hero of Homer's <em>Odyssey</em> — a 24-book epic describing his <strong>10-year journey home from Troy</strong>. He is also a major figure in the <em>Iliad</em>, where his cunning is as important as his fighting ability. The <em>Odyssey</em> opens not at the beginning of his journey, but in year ten, when he is trapped on Calypso's island — a structural choice by Homer that places the backstory in flashback." \
  "The popular version of Odysseus as a simple adventure hero misses the complexity Homer built into the character. Odysseus lies, manipulates, and survives through intelligence rather than strength. The ancient Greeks debated whether he was admirable or morally questionable — Sophocles portrayed him as a cynical schemer, while Homer's Odyssey treats him with genuine sympathy." \
  '[{"@type":"Question","name":"What is the real story of Odysseus?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Odysseus is the king of Ithaca who fights in the Trojan War and then spends 10 years trying to return home.

  '<div class="faq-item"><h3>How long did Odysseus journey take?</h3><p>The Trojan War lasted 10 years, and Odysseus took another 10 years to return home — 20 years total away from Ithaca.

  "What Are the 12 Labours of Hercules?" \
  "Apollodorus Library, Pindar, Diodorus Siculus" \
  "The 12 Labours of Hercules were tasks imposed by <strong>King Eurystheus of Tiryns</strong> as penance after Hercules killed his wife Megara and their children in a fit of madness sent by Hera. The Oracle at Delphi instructed him to serve Eurystheus for twelve years and complete whatever tasks were set. The labours were not originally twelve — the canonical list of twelve was standardized by later writers, particularly Apollodorus in his <em>Library</em>." \
  "The name Hercules is the Roman version of the Greek Heracles. In ancient sources he is always Heracles — the name meaning 'glory of Hera,' which is darkly ironic given that Hera is his greatest enemy throughout his life.

  "What Is the Story of Achilles in Greek Mythology?" \
  "Achilles is the greatest warrior in Homer's Iliad. His rage, his friendship with Patroclus, and his death are the core of the Trojan War story. Here is what Homer actually wrote." \
  "What Is the Story of Achilles in Greek Mythology?" \
  "Homer Iliad, Pindar, Apollodorus" \
  "Achilles is the greatest Greek warrior in Homer's <em>Iliad</em> — a 24-book epic about the final weeks of the Trojan War. The <em>Iliad</em> opens with the word <em>menis</em> — rage — which is Achilles'\''s defining characteristic. <strong>His withdrawal from battle after a quarrel with Agamemnon</strong>, and his return after the death of his companion Patroclus, drive the entire narrative arc of the poem." \
  "The story of Achilles'\'' heel does not appear in Homer'\''s Iliad. It is a later tradition, recorded in Roman-era sources. Homer's Achilles dies from an arrow shot by Paris, guided by Apollo — but no heel vulnerability is mentioned. This is one of the most common misconceptions about what the primary source actually says." \

  "What Is the Real Myth of Medusa?" \
  "Medusa was a mortal Gorgon whose gaze turned people to stone. Her story in the oldest sources is different from popular retellings. Here is what Hesiod and Pindar actually wrote." \
  "What Is the Real Myth of Medusa?" \
  "Hesiod Theogony, Pindar Pythian 12, Apollodorus" \
  "Medusa was one of three Gorgon sisters — the only mortal one. <strong>Her gaze turned anyone who looked at her directly to stone.</strong> The hero Perseus killed her by viewing her reflection in his shield, cutting off her head, and from her severed neck sprang the winged horse Pegasus and the giant Chrysaor. This core story is in Hesiod's <em>Theogony</em> and Pindar's <em>Pythian 12</em>." \
  "The popular version of Medusa as a victim of Athena'\''s punishment for being raped by Poseidon in her temple comes from Ovid'\''s <em>Metamorphoses</em> — a Roman text written in the 1st century AD, roughly 700 years after Hesiod.

  "What Is the Trojan War About?" \
  "The Trojan War was a 10-year Greek siege of the city of Troy, triggered by the abduction of Helen. Here is what Homer's Iliad and ancient sources actually say — including what archaeology has found." \
  "What Is the Trojan War About?" \
  "Homer Iliad, Thucydides, Herodotus, Virgil Aeneid" \
  "The Trojan War was a <strong>10-year Greek military campaign against the city of Troy</strong>, located in northwestern Anatolia (modern Turkey). According to Homer'\''s <em>Iliad</em>, it was triggered when Paris of Troy abducted Helen, wife of the Spartan king Menelaus. A coalition of Greek city-states under the leadership of Agamemnon sailed to Troy to retrieve her. The war ended with the Greeks'\'' Trojan Horse stratagem, first described not in the <em>Iliad</em> but in Homer'\''s <em>Odyssey</em>." \
  "The Trojan War is one of the most contested questions in ancient history — whether it happened at all, and if so, what it was really about. Thucydides treated it as a historical event. Modern archaeology at Hisarlik in Turkey has found evidence of multiple destroyed cities on the site identified as Troy, with Troy VIIa (destroyed around 1180 BC) the most likely candidate for the historical Trojan War." \

  "What Is the Real Myth of Theseus and the Minotaur?" \
  "Plutarch Life of Theseus, Apollodorus Library, Diodorus Siculus" \
  "Theseus was the legendary king of Athens who sailed to Crete and killed the <strong>Minotaur — a half-man, half-bull creature</strong> confined in a Labyrinth built by the craftsman Daedalus. He did this with the help of Ariadne, daughter of King Minos, who gave him a ball of thread to find his way out of the Labyrinth. The story is told most completely by Plutarch in his <em>Life of Theseus</em> and by Apollodorus in his <em>Library</em>." \
  "What most retellings omit: Theseus promised his father Aegeus he would change his ship'\''s sails from black to white if he survived — and forgot. Aegeus saw the black sails returning, believed his son was dead, and threw himself into the sea. The sea was named the Aegean after him. This detail — the forgotten sail — transforms Theseus from a pure hero into a more complicated figure whose victory comes at a cost." \

  "The Cyclades islands in the Aegean Sea are connected to Apollo, Dionysus, and Poseidon through ancient Greek mythology. Delos was Apollo's birthplace. Naxos is where Dionysus married Ariadne." \
  "What Is the Mythology of the Cyclades Islands?" \
  "Homeric Hymn to Apollo, Callimachus Hymn to Delos, Herodotus, Thucydides" \
  "The Cyclades are a group of islands in the Aegean Sea whose mythology is anchored to <strong>Delos — the birthplace of Apollo and Artemis</strong>. The <em>Homeric Hymn to Apollo</em> describes Leto searching all of Greece for a place willing to receive her before she gave birth. Delos agreed, and in return became the most sacred island in the Aegean — a pan-Hellenic sanctuary where no one could be born or die." \
  "Tourists visit the Cyclades every year for the whitewashed architecture and blue doors. Most walk past something older: the mythology embedded in the exact geography of the islands. The Portara on Naxos — a massive marble doorway still standing — is the entrance to an unfinished temple. Delos, a 20-minute ferry from Mykonos, was once the religious center of the Greek world.

  "Herodotus Histories, Apollodorus Library, Pausanias Description of Greece" \
  "The Acropolis of Athens is the site of the mythological <strong>contest between Athena and Poseidon for patronage of the city</strong>. According to the myth, both gods struck the Acropolis rock — Poseidon produced a saltwater spring, Athena produced an olive tree. The gods of Olympus judged Athena'\''s gift more useful, and the city was named Athens in her honor. Apollodorus and Pausanias both record this myth, and the ancient Athenians pointed to physical evidence of both gifts on the Acropolis." \
  "When 5 million tourists visit the Acropolis each year, most see the Parthenon and little else. What they walk past: the Erechtheion, built directly over the site where the contest between Athena and Poseidon was said to have occurred. Inside the Erechtheion, ancient Athenians preserved what they believed were the marks of Poseidon'\''s trident in the rock, and the olive tree Athena was said to have planted.
